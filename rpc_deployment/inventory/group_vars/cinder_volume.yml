# The variables file used by the playbooks in the Cinder-api group.
# These don't have to be explicitly imported by vars_files: they are autopopulated.


# Note, most cinder settings sare set in cinder_all,
# this file is just to override the lvm size for the volumes container.

# The volumes container needs a larger FS as it must have tmp space for
# converting glnace imges to volumes.
# https://github.com/rcbops/ansible-lxc-rpc/issues/166

# Default is 5GB (same as other containers).
# Space must be added for cinder image conversion to work.
# For example, to be able to convert 100GB images, set this to 105GB.
cinder_volume_lv_size_gb: 5GB

# only used when the lxc vg is present on the target
container_lvm_fssize: "{{cinder_volume_lv_size_gb}}"
